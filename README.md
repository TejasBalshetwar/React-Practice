# React-Practice
This repo contains the projects that I have done while learning React. I have used the following resources to learn React:
- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/)

## *Followed the Namaste React course by Akshay Saini.* 

## **Important Points**
### [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/)

- HMR- Hot Module Replacement (No need to refresh the page)
- File watching algorithm created using C++ for HMR
- Caching - Faster builds using .parcel-cache (consistent caching)
- Image optimization
- Minification 
- Production Build
- Bundling
- Code Compression
- Code splitting
- Different Bundling for different browsers
- Diagnostic messages
- Error Handling
- Secure deployment option (https local hosting using --https flag)
- Tree shaking - Remove unused code

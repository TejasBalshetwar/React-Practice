# React-Practice
This repo contains the projects that I have done while learning React. I have used the following resources to learn React:
- [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- [React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-redux/)

## Followed the Namaste React course by Akshay Saini.
